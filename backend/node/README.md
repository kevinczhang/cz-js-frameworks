  scalable network applications.

# Node

Node.js is an open source server environment. Node.js allows you to run JavaScript on the server.

This is in contrast to today's more common concurrency model where OS threads are employed. Thread-based networking is relatively inefficient and very difficult to use. Furthermore, users of Node are free from worries of dead-locking the process, since there are no locks. Almost no function in Node directly performs I/O, so the process never blocks. Because nothing blocks, scalable systems are very reasonable to develop in Node.

Node takes the event model a bit further. It presents an [event loop](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/event-loop-timers-and-nexttick/) as a runtime construct instead of as a library. Node simply enters the event loop after executing the input script. Node exits the event loop when there are no more callbacks to perform. This behavior is like browser JavaScript — the event loop is hidden from the user.

Just because Node is designed without threads, doesn't mean you cannot take advantage of multiple cores in your environment. Child processes can be spawned by using our [`child_process.fork()`](https://nodejs.org/api/child\_process.html#child\_process\_child\_process\_fork\_modulepath\_args\_options) API, and are designed to be easy to communicate with. Built upon that same interface is the [`cluster`](https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html) module, which allows you to share sockets between processes to enable load balancing over your cores.

Node.js is built against modern versions of V8. V8 is Google’s open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. It is used in Chrome and in Node.js, among others.

V8 implements [ECMAScript](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/) and [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/). V8 compiles and executes JavaScript source code, handles memory allocation for objects, and garbage collects objects it no longer needs. V8’s stop-the-world, generational, accurate garbage collector is one of the keys to V8’s performance.

Node.js has a set of built-in modules which you can use without any further installation.
