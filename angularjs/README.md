# AngularJS

AngularJS is an open-source, JavaScript-based, front-end web application framework for dynamic web app development. It utilizes HTML as a template language. By extending HTML attributes with directives and binding data to HTML with expressions, AngularJS creates an environment that is readable, extraordinarily expressive and quick to develop.

AngularJS is a **JavaScript framework**. It can be added to an HTML page with a \<script> tag.

AngularJS extends HTML attributes with **Directives**, and binds data to HTML with **Expressions**.

## AngularJS Extends HTML

AngularJS extends HTML with **ng-directives**.

The **ng-app** directive defines an AngularJS application.

The **ng-model** directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.

The **ng-bind** directive binds application data to the HTML view.

## AngularJS Modules

An AngularJS module defines an application. The module is a container for the different parts of an application. The module is a container for the application controllers. Controllers always belong to a module. You can use the module to add your own directives to your applications.

## Restrictons on directives

The legal restrict values are:

* `E` for Element name
* `A` for Attribute
* `C` for Class
* `M` for Comment

By default the value is `EA`, meaning that both Element names and attribute names can invoke the directive.
