# Forms

Angular provides two different approaches to handling user input through forms: reactive and template-driven. Both capture user input events from the view, validate the user input, create a form model and data model to update, and provide a way to track changes.

* **Reactive forms** are more robust: they're more scalable, reusable, and testable. If forms are a key part of your application, or you're already using reactive patterns for building your application, use reactive forms.
* **Template-driven forms** are useful for adding a simple form to an app, such as an email list signup form. They're easy to add to an app, but they don't scale as well as reactive forms. If you have very basic form requirements and logic that can be managed solely in the template, use template-driven forms.

| REACTIVE           | TEMPLATE-DRIVEN                           |                                      |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Setup (form model) | More explicit, created in component class | Less explicit, created by directives |
| Data model         | Structured                                | Unstructured                         |
| Predictability     | Synchronous                               | Asynchronous                         |
| Form validation    | Functions                                 | Directives                           |
| Mutability         | Immutable                                 | Mutable                              |
| Scalability        | Low-level API access                      | Abstraction on top of APIs           |

### Common foundation  <a href="#common-foundation" id="common-foundation"></a>

Both reactive and template-driven forms share underlying building blocks.

* [`FormControl`](https://angular.io/api/forms/FormControl) tracks the value and validation status of an individual form control.
* [`FormGroup`](https://angular.io/api/forms/FormGroup) tracks the same values and status for a collection of form controls.
* [`FormArray`](https://angular.io/api/forms/FormArray) tracks the same values and status for an array of form controls.
* [`ControlValueAccessor`](https://angular.io/api/forms/ControlValueAccessor) creates a bridge between Angular [`FormControl`](https://angular.io/api/forms/FormControl) instances and native DOM elements.
