# Angular

Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications in HTML and TypeScript. Angular is written in TypeScript. It implements core and optional functionality as a set of TypeScript libraries that you import into your apps.

The architecture of an Angular application relies on certain fundamental concepts. The basic building blocks are _NgModules_, which provide a compilation context for _components_. NgModules collect related code into functional sets; an Angular app is defined by a set of NgModules. An app always has at least a _root module_ that enables bootstrapping, and typically has many more _feature modules_.

* Components define _views_, which are sets of screen elements that Angular can choose among and modify according to your program logic and data.
* Components use _services_, which provide specific functionality not directly related to views. Service providers can be _injected_ into components as _dependencies_, making your code modular, reusable, and efficient.
